.SH NAME
credentials \- knfs credentials input file format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /var/athena/credentials
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B credentials
file is read by
.IR mkcred (1)
to generate db files needed by the Kerberized NFS mountd to tell it
what Kerberos principal names map to what local UIDs, and what local
groups those users are in.
.PP
The file consists of an arbitrary number of lines of the format:
.RS 8
.B username:uid:primary gid:gid:gid:...
.RE
The first three fields are required. (The primary gid will normally be
101 (mit) for Athena users.) After the three required fields there can
be any number of supplementary gids (including none), although
.I mkcred
may ignore later gids if the size of the list exceeds the OS-defined
limit.
.PP
The colon after the last gid on a line may be omitted.
